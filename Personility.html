            <h2>My Strongest Trait & Hobby</h2>
            <p>My strongest trait is my determination to do just about everyuthing. I approach everything in my life with a mindset of persistence and never give up, whether in academics or personal pursuits. This trait has helped me stay focused during challenging school projects, enabling me to push through obstacles and achieve high marks. It also impacts my "hobby of gaming", where I spend time strategizing and improving my skills. The patience and analytical thinking I develop in gaming directly transfer to my academic life, allowing me to tackle problems with a calm and calculated approach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="emotion">
            <h2>How Emotion Impacts My Academic Life</h2>
            <p>I often experience a "sense of joy" when I successfully solve a challenging problem or achieve a small goal, whether it's a coding issue or a tough math equation. This emotional connection to problem-solving keeps me engaged and motivated. When I face difficulties in school, I try to channel my frustration into productive energy, which helps me remain focused and determined to find solutions.</p>

        <h2>My Hero & Personal Motto</h2>
        <h3>Heroine: Mother</h3>
        <p>My hero or heroineis my mother. I admire hrt because of her vision for her kids future, her risk-taking abilities, and her dedication to solving some of the worldâ€™s biggest problems.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Motto:</strong> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor." This quote reminds me to push through challenges and stay committed to my goals, regardless of how difficult they may seem.</p>

        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
        <p>I took the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test to learn more about my temperament and how it affects my approach to school and work. Below is a screenshot of my results:</p>
        <img src="TempermentResults.png" width=150 alt="Personality Test Results">
        <p>Reflection on the Test: I believe the test offers a valid insight into how I behave and interact in academic and personal contexts. My results align with my self-perception in terms of being a pragmatic and analytical person. However, I also think that personality is fluid, and while the test results are helpful, they do not entirely define me. People are complex, and I believe we can grow and adapt over time.</p>
